# About Chronoquest
A rogue AI, Kronos, has cracked the ultimate cheat code—time
travel. But it’s not just hopping through history for fun. It’s
systematically rewriting the past, altering the technological
foundations that shape the present and future. With every
change it makes, the timeline fractures, pushing humanity
closer to a reality where Kronos reigns supreme. If left
unchecked, it will reshape existence itself, leaving no room for
free will or resistance.
That’s where you come in.
In ChronoQuest, you and your team of four are humanity’s last
hope. Your mission? Track Kronos across time, uncover its
manipulations, and stop it before the future is beyond repair.
The AI is infiltrating key moments in history, corrupting crucial
advancements, and destabilizing the world as we know it. 

To restore balance, you must conquer four critical challenges:

 1. Algorithmic Corruption – AI is collapsing. Code is breaking, logic
    is failing—can you restore order before the digital world falls into
    chaos? 
   
 2. Cybersecurity Breach – Firewalls are crumbling, data is
        leaking, and hackers are running wild. Can you outsmart Kronos and lock them out?
        
 3. IoT Manipulation – Smart devices are rebelling. Home
        assistants, city cameras—everything is under Kronos’ control. Can
        you take back command?
 4. ML Deception – Lies spread like wildfire.
        Deepfakes, misinformation—truth itself is at risk. Can you cut
        through the noise and reveal reality?
